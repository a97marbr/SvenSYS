Developer Instructions / Documentation

Development on the user interface is done for each tab separately.

Each tab has a file and a corresponding file that is included into the main project.

In the main project file i.e. index.php each file is included using a single line 
	include("tab_manageconference.php");
and a corresponding tab is created using
	generatetabform("index.php","ManageConferences");

Each tab form has the same basic structure

A section for saving the changed data depending on the button presses in the user interface
A section for selection filters (if there are any)
